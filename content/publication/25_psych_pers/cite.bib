  abstract = {Personality disorders (PDs) are at a crossroads in classification
              and conceptualization. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI)
              and natural language processing hold promise for clarifying PD
              models and improving research methodology, understanding, and
              ultimately clinical treatment. This study uses language for
              modeling personality and personality pathology. A representative
              community sample of N = 1,409 older adults across the St. Louis
              region (33\% Black, 65\% white, 2\% other) completed a life
              narrative interview from which language was used to train and
              test language models of personality based on scores from the
              NEO-Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-R) and the Structured
              Interview for DSM-IV Personality (SIDP-IV). Criteria measures
              were used for multi-method construct validation of the language
              models including self-report measures of physical functioning and
              depressive symptoms and informant-report measures of personality,
              general health status, and social functioning. Language from life
              narrative interviews was modeled to identify personality through
              fine-tuning the parameters of the RoBERTa language model,
              BERTopic topic modeling, and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count.
              Fine-tuned RoBERTa models predicted personality scores in testing
              data above r = .40. Language in life narrative interviews
              supports the semantic similarity of the five-factor model (FFM)
              personality trait domains more than DSM personality disorder
              categories, for which only borderline pathology had support. The
              language-based FFM scores were supported by multi-method criteria
              correlations including informant-report personality scores in the
              testing data. Findings support dimensional conceptualization of
              personality and demonstrate the promise of language-based AI to
              refine conceptual frameworks of PD and provide automatic
              personality assessment and prediction in research and clinical
              practice.},
