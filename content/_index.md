        My Master's thesis is on risk of Alzheimer's Disease prediction using resource-efficient and explainable LLMs, mentored by [Dr. Jennifer Dworak](https://www.smu.edu/lyle/departments/ece/people/faculty/dworak-jennifer), [Dr. Eric Larson](https://www.smu.edu/lyle/departments/cs/people/faculty/larson-eric) and [Dr. Jia Zhang](https://www.smu.edu/lyle/departments/cs/people/faculty/zhang-jia). This thesis aims to develop a predictive metric for risk of Alzheimer's Disease based on natural language, using LLM finetuning, embedding analysis, and other ML and NLP techniques.

        I have been developing a regression algorithm with LLMs to predict personality scores under [Dr. Mehak Gupta](https://www.smu.edu/lyle/departments/cs/people/faculty/gupta-mehak), involving research in deep learning and NLP with applications in healthcare. Our papers, [AI Assistant for Socioeconomic Empowerment Using Federated Learning](https://aclanthology.org/2025.nlp4dh-1.42/) has been published to [NLP4DH](https://nlp4dh.com/) at [NAACL 2025](https://2025.naacl.org); [Language-Based AI Modeling of Personality Traits and Pathology from Life Narrative Interviews](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/390926024_Language-Based_AI_Modeling_of_Personality_Traits_and_Pathology_from_Life_Narrative_Interviews) has been published to [Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/abn)

        My independent research on LLMs as recommender systems mentored by [Dr. Michael Hahsler](https://www.smu.edu/lyle/departments/cs/people/faculty/hahsler-michael) of Computer Science at the Lyle School of Engineering, and [Dr. Peter Moore](https://people.smu.edu/pmoore/) of Mathematics at the Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences. [A Recommender System Architecture for University Curriculum Advising](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI-SS/article/view/35593) has been published to [AAAI Spring Symposium](https://aaai.org/conference/spring-symposia/sss25/) and to [NCUR](https://www.cur.org/events-services/ncur/). The research was funded by the [Robert Mayer Undergraduate Research Fellowship](https://www.smu.edu/dedman/research/institutes-and-centers/dcii/fellowships/mayer).

        This summer, I trained AlphaFold based Stable Diffusion models that predict multi-frame protein trajectory in [Dr. Peng Tao](https://www.smu.edu/dedman/academics/departments/chemistry/people/faculty/pengtao)'s [Proteins and Computers Lab](https://s2.smu.edu/ptao/index.html). I also developed a Python package, [PyTAO](https://github.com/JerMa88/PyTAO), to assist ONIOM calculations in AMBER and Gaussian.

        In [Dr. Corey Clark](https://www.smu.edu/lyle/departments/cs/people/faculty/clark-corey)'s [HuMIn Game Lab](https://humingamelab.com), I am developing a Graph-RAG vector/graph database using [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro), striving for faster and more relevant text data retrieval and lookup.
