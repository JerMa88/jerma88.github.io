I was awarded the [Robert Mayer Undergraduate Research Fellowship](https://www.smu.edu/dedman/research/institutes-and-centers/dcii/fellowships/mayer) for 2024-25 by the [Dedman College Interdisciplinary Institute](https://www.smu.edu/dedman/research/institutes-and-centers/dcii) (DCII) of SMU. I will work on the project (Recommender Systems and Set-Cover Algorithms for University Curriculum Advising)[https://www.smu.edu/dedman/research/institutes-and-centers/dcii/fellowships/mayer/current-mayer-fellows]. [Dr. Michael Hahsler](mailto:mhahsler@smu.edu) [:link:](https://michael.hahsler.net/) of Computer Science at the Bobby B. Lyle School of Engineering acts as my main mentor with [Dr. Peter Moore](mailto:pmoore@smu.edu) [:link:](https://people.smu.edu/pmoore/) of Mathematics at the Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences as a co-mentor.

I am excited to work on this project and grateful for the opportunity to learn from these two great professors. I am looking forward to the research experience and the knowledge I will gain from this project. I am also grateful for the financial support from the Mayer Fellowship, which will allow me to focus on my research and studies.
