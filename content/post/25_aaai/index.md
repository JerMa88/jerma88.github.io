[A Recommender System Architecture for University Curriculum Advising](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI-SS/article/view/35593): published to [AAAI Spring Symposium](https://aaai.org/conference/spring-symposia/sss25/), March 2025 (1st Author)

I presented my publication, "A Recommender System Architecture for University Curriculum Advising," at the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) 2025 Spring Symposium. I gained valuable knowledge and insights in cutting-edge human-compatible AI with like-minded fellow researchers to think beyond the norm for better AI that benefits all humanity.
